# MASSTREE-BETA RELEASE 0.1 #

This is the README file for the source release for Masstree - a fast key-value
store for multicore. The purpose of the document is to describe the code
layout, and necessary information for you to run Masstree and interpreting the
result.  More recent information may be available at
[Masstree website](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/masstree).

##CONTENTS##

* `MTDIR`                     This directory
* `MTDIR/doc`               Masstree algorithm specification

##Install##
Masstree is tested on Debian, Ubuntu and Mac OS X. Install Masstree as:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

By default, Masstree links with glibc's malloc. You can also configure Masstree
to link with another memory allocator as:

    ./configure --with-malloc=<jemalloc|flow|tcmalloc>`.

Flow is our re-implementation of
[Streamflow](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~scschnei/streamflow/) allocator, and may
be open-sourced in future.

See `./configure --help` for more configure options.


##Test Masstree in a single process##

The quickiest and simplest way to try out Masstree is the `./mttest` program.
(**Note that this test doesn't involve disk or network overhead.**)

<pre>
$ ./mttest

The test starts a process which hosts a Masstree, generates and execute queries
over the tree. It uses all available cores (two in the above example). The test
lasts for 20 seconds. It populates the key-value store with `put` queries
during first 10 seconds, and then issues `get` queries over the tree during the
second10 seconds, i.e. the getting phase. See `kvtest_rw1_seed` in `mttest.hh`
for more details about the workload and other workloads that `mttest` supports.

The output summarizes the throughput of each core. The `1/1 rw1/m` line says
that `mttest` is running the first trial (out of one trials), of the `rw1`
workload using Masstree (`m` for short) as the internal data structure.

The rest of the result mainly consists of two parts. First is the per-core
throughput summary, as indicated by `0: {"table":"mb","test":"rw1",...}`. The
rest is the gnuplot source that plot the median per-core throughput. If you
plot it, each candlestick has five points, each represents the
min,20%,50%,70%,max of the corresponding metric among all threads.

##Output format##

`mttest` can also write the output as JSON into file for further analysis. For
example, `./mttest -b notebook.json` will create `notebook.json` containing:

<pre>
{
  "experiments":{
    "x0":{
      "git-revision":"673994c43d58d46f4ebf3f7d4e1fce19074594cb",

    }
  },
  "data":{
    "x0\/rw1\/mb\/0":[
      {
        "table":"mb",
        "test":"rw1",
        "trial":0,
        "thread":0,
        "puts":13243551,

      },
      {
        "table":"mb",
        "test":"rw1",
        "trial":0,
        "thread":1,
        "puts":13242601,

        "ops":26485202,
        "ops_per_sec":1398395.26601
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>

##Test Masstree with `mtclient`##

`mtclient` supports almost the same set of workloads that `mttest` does, but it
sends queries to the Masstree deamon over network.

To start Masstree daemon, run:

<pre>
$ ./mtd --logdir=[LOG_DIRS]  --ckdir=[CHECKPOINT_DIRS]
mb, Bag, pin-threads disabled, logging enabled
no ./kvd-ckp-gen
no ./kvd-ckp-0-0
no ./kvd-ckp-0-1
2 udp threads
2 tcp threads
</pre>

`LOG_DIRS` is a comma-separated list of directories storing Masstree
logs, and `CHECKPOINT_DIRS` is a comm-separated list of directory storing
Masstree checkpoints.

To run `rw1` workload with `mtclient` on the same machine as `mtd`, run:

<pre>
$ ./mtclient -s 127.0.0.1 rw1
tcp, w 500, test rw1, children 2
